## Chapter 1
### Building blocks of a web application
There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

* User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
* Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
* Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
* Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
* Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
* Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
* Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
* Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
* Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.

> React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces

> Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

## Chapter 2
> The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.

## Chapter 3
> Imperative vs. declarative programming

## Chapter 4
> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.

## Chapter 5
There are three core concepts of React
* Components
* Props
* State

> User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

## Chapter 6
> You can pass pieces of information as properties to React components. These are called props.

## Chapter 7
> React has a set of functions called hooks. Hooks allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components.
> You can think of state as any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction.

## Chapter 8
While React excels at building UI, it does take some work to independently build that UI into a fully functioning scalable application. There are also newer React features, like Server and Client Components, that require a framework.
